[Prerequisites]
1. CON-FMC board
2. CON-FMC package installed
3. FPGA board with FMC connector
4. Xilinx package: Vivado

[FPGA for Vivado]
1. Make sure 'XILINX_VIVADO' environemt varialbe indicte the directory of Vivado package
   - Simply run '$ source /tools/Xilinx/Vivado/2022.1/settings64.sh'
   E.g., /tools/Xilinx/Vivado/2022.1
2. Make sure 'CONFMC_HOME' environment variable indicate the directory of CON-FMC package
   - Simply run '$ source /opt/confmc/2020.06/setting64.sh'
   E.g., /opt/confmc/2020.06
3. Simulation
   - go to "hw.single/sim/xsim"
   - run "make"
   - simulation waveform will be ready in 'wave.vcd', which can be displayed using 'gtkwave'.
4. Logic synthesis and PnR (implementation)
   - go to "hw.single/pnr/vivado.zed.lpc"
   - run "make"
5. Program FPGA
   - connect USB to CON-FMC
   - connect USB-to-JTAG
   - download bit-stream
      . go to  "hw.single/pnr/vivado.zed.lpc/download"
      . run "make"
6. Running C program along with FPGA through CON-FMC
   - compile and run
      . go to "sw.native/test_mem"
      . run 'make cleanup; make run'

[FPGA for ISE]
Note that ISE version may be have problem due to deprecated features,
if so, please contact at Future Design Systems.
1. Make sure 'XILINX' environemt varialbe indicte the directory of ISE package
   - Simply run '$ source /opt/Xilinx/14.7/ISE_DS/settings64.sh'
   E.g., /opt/Xilinx/14.7/ISE_DS/ISE
2. Make sure 'CONFMC_HOME' environment variable indicate the directory of CON-FMC package
   - Simply run '$ source /opt/confmc/2020.06/setting64.sh'
   E.g., /opt/confmc/2020.06
3. Simulation
   - go to "hw.single/sim/modelsim.ise"
   - run "make"
4. Logic synthesis, where 'v6' should be changed according to the FPGA family
   - go to "hw.single/syn/xst.v6"
   - run "make"
5. PnR
   - go to "hw.single/pnr/ise.ml605.lpc"
   - run "make"
6. Program FPGA
   - connect USB to CON-FMC
   - connect USB-to-JTAG
   - download bit-stream
      . go to  "hw.single/pnr/ise.ml605.lpc/download"
      . run "make"
7. Running C program along with FPGA through CON-FMC
   - compile and run
      . go to "sw.native/test_mem"
      . run 'make cleanup; make run'

Have fun.
